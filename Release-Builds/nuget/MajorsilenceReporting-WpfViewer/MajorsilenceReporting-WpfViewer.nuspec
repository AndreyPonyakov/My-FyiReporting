    <summary>Report and charting system based on Microsoft's Report Definition.  This contains the wpf viewer component.</summary>
    <description>Majorsilence Reporting is a fork of fyiReporting. I cannot stress this enough. This is a FORK. The main purpose is to make sure that I have a copy of fyiReporting since that project seems to be dead.

"FYIReporting Designer is a report and charting system based on Microsoft's Report Definition Language (RDL). Tabular, free form, matrix, charts are fully supported. HTML, PDF, XML, .Net Control, and printing supported. A WYSIWYG designer allows you to create reports without knowledge of RDL. Wizards are available for creating new reports and for inserting new tables, matrixes, and charts into existing reports." (http://www.fyireporting.com/)
